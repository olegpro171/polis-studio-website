# Polis Studio (WIP)

Implemented models:
- Project (main model)
- ProjectCard (needed as the Project may have multiple display cards with differrent images)
- Image
- Blueprint
(As the two latter ones represent virtually the same data, consider to merge them into one)

Active endpoints:
- ```/projects/```
- ```/projects/<id: int>/```

TO DO:
- endpoints for images, project cards
- endpoint for crearing new projects
- set correct permissions
